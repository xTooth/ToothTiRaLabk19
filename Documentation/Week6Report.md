# Sixth Week

## What I did

This week I found myself kind of pressed for time. This means my grand plan kind of went sideways. I was trying to look for a good way of implementing the dijkstra algorithm,
but couldn't find any decent documentation on it for this application, which means I most likley will leave it out all togeather. What I did in terms
of programming was implement a random(ish) class that will return a random integer, and refactored all of the code to purely use datastructures 
I've built myself. I also got started on some performance testing (which is not yet committed). I think I spent around 10 hours working on this project
this week.

## What I learned

Dijksra isn't a great algorithm for solving problems were all the vertices are of equal weight. Also ended up taking a deeper dive than necessary
for my applications into random generation.

## Questions

Am I on good track? Thats really it. (I know I need to flesh out the documentation.) I would also like to know weather I can hook up a MacBook
at the Demo event. ( It has 2 usb-c ports, nothing else and I dont own any adapters)

## Next Week

Lots of work on the documentation, potentially some optimization work on the HashTable implementation, since it currently gets a metric ton of collisions
making it slow. The fix is either to somehow spread out the hashes or to swap the linked list for some sort of tree (or both).
