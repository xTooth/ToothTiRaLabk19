# Project Definition #
The aim of this project is to create a program that is able to solve any solvable variatoin of the 15-puzzle.
This program will be written in Java. 
## Algorithms and data structrures ##
The program will likely use an A* algorithm to find the solution. A* uses maps, sets and lists as its datastructures.
## Input and output ##
 I happened to find a version of the 15 game written in JavaFX and might therefore
implement a grapchical input/game in the solution. The other option is to simply take a 2 dimensional array as an input, and output.
Either way the algorithm will work using a two dimensional array as both an input and output.
## Time Complexity ##
Ideally the algoritm would work in O(|E|) time. Which is the worst case time for the A* algorithm.
## Reason for picking this project ##
Honestly I had a hard time coming up with anything smart for this project. This problem seemed like a nice way to incorporate routefinding
algoritms in a game enviornment.
