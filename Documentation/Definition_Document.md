# Project Definition #
The aim of this project is to create algorithms that are capable of solving 15 puzzles and compare their performance.
This program will be written in Java. 
## Algorithms and data structrures ##
The program will likely use an A*, BFS and some other solving algoritms. The datastructures will atleast include HashSets, and PriorityQueues.
## Input and output ##
 I happened to find a version of the 15 game written in JavaFX and might therefore
implement a grapchical input/game in the solution. The other option is to simply take an array as an input, and output.
Either way the algorithm will work using an array as both an input and output.
## Time Complexity ##
This is currently a big questionmark, I will update this as I get further in the project.
## Reason for picking this project ##
Honestly I had a hard time coming up with anything smart for this project. This problem seemed like a nice way to incorporate routefinding
algoritms in a game enviornment.
