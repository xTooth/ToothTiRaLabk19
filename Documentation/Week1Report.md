# First week #
### What I did ###
This week I chose my subject based on some research and a lot of googling of different project ideas. So far the program is just an empty gradle shell.
### What I learned ###
Well that choosing a project for this is surpisingly difficult, due to the fact that it has to be broad enough but also achievable in the timeframe we have.
### Questions and unclear things ###
The main thing here is I would like to get some feedback on wether the project seems broad enough. Also to what extent is it okay to use previous solutions by other people in
building my own. For example: Is it considered ok to use a prebuilt game logic + UI for a project like this and only modify it to suit my needs.

Also does EVERY datastructure have to be built from scratch?

Mainly Arrays? Or is it okay to use the "[]" operator on a given type.

Strings? since theyare Character arrays of sorts.

### Next week ###
I hope to get a working algorithm done during next week. This might prove to be hard and or require lots more research, since I've only written an A* algorithm once
on another course and implementing it on a problem like this is totally unfamiliar to me.

#### Note ####
Sources in the defining document are subject to change since I had little time this week to look into the subject.
