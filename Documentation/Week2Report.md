# Second Week

## What I did

This week I focused on getting some basic algorithms together and in general actually
wrapping my head around the problem at hand.(I wanted to try my hand at solving this without outside input/research to see how far I'd get.) I did get to writing some code and ran a few tests to see how a barebones BFS and
my own solution worked. Both work for small changes, at least up to 11 shuffles, but somwhere bayond that it gets BAD. This is however 
most likley due to the lack of a set that would save allready visited states of the game. Which I will add, but I had limited time this week.


## What I learned

As it turns out it is alot harder than I initially thought and alot
of my time has been used trying to come up with an elegant and fast solution.
I am at the moment straying further from an A* solution. 
Mainly this means I'll have to spend a considerable amount of time next week
doing research on how to solve this sort of problem in the most efficient way. Especially focusing on good
ways to give weight to a given gamestate.

## Questions

Nothing really specific. Just hope for some feedback on what I've managed to get done this week, and my plans for the incoming one.

## Next Week

Iron out the flaws in what I have built now. Research smarter solutions and implement some established algorithms. Hopefully also build some sort of
UI / interface. This is however kind of second in priority as the other tasks will take up a lot of time. It might be that I end up comparing the efficiency of different solutions rather than just 
simply building a solver.
