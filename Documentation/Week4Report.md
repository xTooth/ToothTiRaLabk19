# Fourth week #
### What I did ###
This week was spent mostly doing research and attempting to actually understand hashing and hashSets. This reasearch seems to have gone somewhat well
since my implementation of a "hashingishtable" seems to be faster than a hashSet in this application. Now this might be due to a number of errors
in my previous code. But just changing the HashSet out for my HashingishTable resulted in WAY more effective searching. In total I spent around 20 hours
researching and writing code this week. Pulling together a shuffler to aid in testing as well as the new "hashtable".

### What I learned ###
I ended up learning alot about hashing in Java. Which in a sense is interesing. But mostly I learned to appreciate prebuilt libraries. HashMaps/sets and so on are
really nice to have, and not that fun to make.
### Questions and unclear things ###
At this point in time just some general feedback on the project would be nice. Am I taking it in the right direction. And most importantly is 
my Hashing function good enough or do I need to work on it some more?

### Next week ###
I hope to get a priorityQueue structure done that would function in reasonable time. Also do a deep dive on the project I get assigned to look at.
